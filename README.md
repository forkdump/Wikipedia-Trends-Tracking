# Wikipedia-Trends-Tracking

We have developed the application that gives up top 10 trending topics from Wikipedia.
Throughout the development of this project we learned a lot about multiple services that are
provided by AWS. We learned how to use S3 service which provides cost-effective object
storage for a wide variety of use cases including cloud applications, backup and archiving and
big data analytics. We have also used EMR service which simplifies big data processing by
providing Hadoop framework that makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective for us to process vast
amounts of your data across dynamically scalable Amazon EC2 instances. We have also took
benefits of Elasticsearch and Kibana which are data manipulation and data virtualization
platforms that allow us to interact with data with stunning powerful graphics.
